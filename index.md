## The Renaissance Simulation Laboratory

![Renaissance Simulations](images/renaissance_sims.png)

## Welcome to the Renaissance Simulation Laboratory!

The Renaissance Simulations are a series of highly sophisticated computer
simulations of galaxy formation in the early Universe. These simulations
were run on the [Blue Waters](https://bluewaters.ncsa.illinois.edu/)
supercomputer at the [National Center for Supercomputing
Applications](http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/) and produced more than 50 TB
of raw data and other data products, such as halo catalogs, merger trees,
and mock observations. The Renaissance Simulation Laboratory (RSL) provides
open access to all of this data, through both direct download and live
analysis using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

Here's what you'll find at the RSL:

 - [**Learn**](learn.html): If you're new to galaxy formation and
   computational astrophysics, the [Learn](learn.html) section
   covers the basics of these topics.

 - [**Investigate**](investigate.html): Go here for access to the Renaissance
   Simulation data and to begin your analysis.

 - [**Showcase**](showcase.html): See a gallery of images, movies, and papers
   created with Renaissance Simulation data.

 - [**User Guide**](user_guide.html): Here you'll find more information
   on how to access and analyze Renaissance Simulation data.
