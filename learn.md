# The first galaxies in the universe

## Then and now

The universe is filled with countless galaxies today. But there was a time not
long after the big bang when there were no galaxies at all—just tiny
fluctuations in the density of matter. How does a featureless universe “grow
galaxies”? And how do they differ from modern galaxies like the Milky Way?

Gravity collects regions of slight overdensity in the early universe into dense
clumps of gas and dark matter cosmologists call halos. These halos merge and
coalesce to form the first galaxies (protogalaxies). As time goes on,
protogalaxies merge and coalesce into larger galaxies, and so on, until today we
have a variety of galaxy types and sizes. These include large spiral galaxies
like the Milky Way, and large elliptical galaxies, like M87. Thus, galaxies are
said to grow hierarchically, with large modern galaxies representing the
assembly of thousands of protogalaxies which are much smaller.

## Observing the First Galaxies

Can we observe the first galaxies directly? No. They are too small and too faint
for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to detect them. However the HST can detect
very faint, distant galaxies which are likely second and third generation
galaxies. The graphic at right shows how deep the HST has been able to probe.
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field  has detected galaxies when the universe was only
400-700 million years old, which is only a few percent of its present age.

The James Webb Space Telescope, to be launched by NASA in 2018, should be able
to observe even younger galaxies, pushing into the realm of truly first
galaxies.

## Faint Red Blobs at the Edge of the Universe

While not strictly the first galaxies in the universe, the most distant galaxies
detected by the HST are worthy of study. They appear as faint red blobs in the
Hubble Ultra Deep Field. They are red because the expansion of the universe has
redshifted their starlight into the red part of the visible spectrum. They are
faint because they are distant. And they are very small compared to the Milky
Way galaxy. A typical size is about 500 parsec, which is 1/50 the size of the
Milky Way galaxy.
