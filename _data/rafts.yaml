- {description: 'This is a brief tutorial of working with merger tree data using ytree.


    ### Instructions

    1. Click the green button that says "Run raft." This will bring you into a file
    browser inside a running Jupyter.

    1. Click on the file called `Working with Merger Trees.ipynb`.


    This will bring you to a Jupyter notebook tutorial of working with the merger
    tree data. You can read the notebook or make changes and rerun it. This notebook
    operates on the actual Renaissance Simulation merger trees.

    - To run a notebook cell, type `shift+enter`.

    - To edit a cell, type `enter`.  Type `shift+enter` to run it.

    - To download the notebook, go to the `File` menu and select `Download as`.',
